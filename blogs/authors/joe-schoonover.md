Joe Schoonover is a scientist and research software engineer at Fluid Numerics. He received a Bachelor's of Science degree in Applied Mathematics & Physics in 2011 and a PhD in Geophysical Fluid Dynamics in 2016 from Florida State University. From 2016-2017, Dr. Schoonover held a post-doctoral research position at Los Alamos National Laboratory's Center for Nonlinear Studies, where he studied topographic wave arrest as a mechanism for western boundary current separation, transport operator diagnosis through impulse functions and graph theory, climate model equilibration acceleration strategies, and high performance computing. Joe's current research focus is in spectral element methods, physical oceanography, and environmental fluid dynamics and he has a continued interest in portable GPU programming and scientific application modernization.
