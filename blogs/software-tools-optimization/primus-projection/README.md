# Primus Projection: Estimate Memory and Performance Before You Train

Planning a large-scale distributed training run is expensive — both in time and in GPU hours. Misconfiguring parallelism settings can lead to out-of-memory crashes, underutilized hardware, or unexpectedly long training times. Primus includes a **projection** tool that lets you answer two critical questions *before* committing to a full-scale run: **"Will it fit?"** and **"How fast will it be?"**

This blog covers the design and capabilities of the Primus projection tool, which provides analytical **memory estimation** and **performance projection** for large-scale LLM training across multi-node clusters of AMD Instinct™ GPUs.

> **Ready to try it?** Jump to the [Quick Start](#quick-start) section for commands you can run immediately.

## Background

Training large language models (LLMs) requires careful orchestration of multiple parallelism strategies — Tensor Parallelism (TP), Pipeline Parallelism (PP), Expert Parallelism (EP), Context Parallelism (CP), and Data Parallelism (DP). Each strategy trades off memory, compute, and communication differently. The combinatorial space of possible configurations makes it impractical to try every setup on actual hardware.

Existing approaches often rely on rules of thumb or trial-and-error: launch a full training run, observe whether it OOMs, measure throughput, tweak settings, and repeat. For models at the 100B+ parameter scale running across dozens of nodes, each iteration of this loop can waste hours of cluster time.

Primus projection takes a different approach: **estimate first, then run**. The memory projection uses analytical formulas derived from the model architecture and parallelism configuration to predict per-GPU memory usage. The performance projection benchmarks representative layers on a configurable number of GPUs — from a single GPU up to a full node — and then analytically projects performance to arbitrary multi-node configurations using communication models and pipeline schedule simulation.

## Primus Projection

The projection tool operates in two modes, each targeting a different stage of the planning process.

| Mode | Command | What it does |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **Memory** | `projection memory` | Estimates per-GPU memory (parameters, optimizer, activations) using analytical formulas |
| **Performance** | `projection performance` | Benchmarks layers on a configurable number of GPUs, then projects training time to multi-node clusters |

Our main contributions can be summarized as follows:

1. A **hierarchical memory profiler** that mirrors the model's module structure to produce per-GPU memory estimates encompassing parameters, optimizer state, and activations.

2. A **hybrid performance projection engine** that combines real GPU benchmarks with analytical communication and pipeline schedule models to project training throughput to arbitrary multi-node configurations.

3. A **sub-node benchmarking methodology** that automatically *downscales* the target parallelism configuration to fit on as few GPUs as available — even a single GPU — by reducing dimensions in a principled priority order (PP → EP → TP), and then analytically *upscales* each dimension to reconstruct full-scale performance.

4. **Communication modeling** covering AllReduce, All-to-All, and P2P collectives with algorithm selection and topology-aware bandwidth/latency parameters.

5. Integrate a **pipeline schedule simulator** supporting 1F1B, interleaved, and zero-bubble schedules to precisely account for pipeline bubble overhead in projected performance.

6. A **pure analytical simulation mode** using the [Origami](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-libraries/tree/develop/shared/origami) GEMM model and a Flash Attention v3 tile-level simulator that enables capacity planning entirely without GPU access — including pre-silicon estimation for future hardware.

### Memory Projection

The memory projection estimates **per-GPU memory** by analytically computing three components: parameter memory, optimizer state memory, and activation memory. It uses a hierarchical profiler system that mirrors the model's module structure.

#### Hierarchical Profiler Architecture

Each component of the model has a corresponding profiler that computes its contribution:

```text
LanguageModelProfiler
├── EmbeddingProfiler              — vocab embeddings (stage 0 only)
├── DenseTransformerLayerProfiler  — for non-MoE layers
│   ├── LayerNormProfiler (×3)     — pre-attn, pre-MLP, post-MLP
│   ├── AttentionProfiler          — QKV projections + attention
│   ├── ResidualAddProfiler (×2)   — skip connections
│   └── DenseMLPProfiler           — standard SwiGLU/FFN
├── MoETransformerLayerProfiler    — for MoE layers
│   ├── LayerNormProfiler (×3)
│   ├── AttentionProfiler
│   ├── ResidualAddProfiler (×2)
│   ├── RouterProfiler             — expert routing logits
│   └── MoEMLPProfiler             — routed experts + shared expert
├── LayerNormProfiler              — final layer norm (last stage only)
├── OutputLayerProfiler            — language model head (last stage only)
└── LossProfiler                   — cross-entropy loss (last stage only)
```

Each profiler implements two key methods:

- `estimated_num_params(rank)` — parameter count (total if `rank=None`, per-GPU if rank given)
- `estimated_activation_memory(batch_size, seq_len)` — activation bytes for one microbatch

#### Parameter and Optimizer Memory

Parameters are computed per component and summed across all layers assigned to a GPU's pipeline stage. The total bytes per parameter depend on training precision and optimizer sharding:

```text
bytes_per_param = weight_bytes + gradient_bytes + optimizer_bytes

Where:
  weight_bytes    = 2      (BF16 weights)
  gradient_bytes  = 2      (BF16 gradients)
  optimizer_bytes = 10/DP  (FP32 master weights + Adam m + Adam v, sharded across DP)
                  = (2 + 4 + 4) / DP
```

#### Activation Memory

Activation memory is the memory needed to store intermediate tensors for the backward pass. The dominant contributor in MoE models is the MoE MLP, where each token is routed to `topk` experts, multiplying the activation footprint:

```text
MoE MLP activation = tokens × (topk + N_shared) × (H + 3×FFN_e) × 2 bytes
```

For a large MoE model (MBS=4, S=16384, CP=4, H=8192, FFN_e=2048, topk=36), a single MoE layer's activation is ~16.19 GB — compared to ~0.51 GB for attention.

#### Pipeline Schedule Memory Scaling

With pipeline parallelism, multiple microbatches are in-flight simultaneously. The peak activation memory depends on the pipeline schedule:

```text
total_activation = base_activation × PP × interleaved_penalty × ga_saving
```

Where `interleaved_penalty = 1 + (PP - 1) / (PP × VPP)` accounts for VPP overhead, and `ga_saving` handles cases where gradient accumulation steps are fewer than PP stages.

#### Recomputation Support

Activation recomputation trades compute for memory. With full recompute, a MoE layer's stored activation drops from ~18 GB to just `sbh` ≈ 0.25 GB (only the input checkpoint). The profiler models partial recomputation as well, where only a subset of layers per VPP stage are recomputed.

### Performance Projection

The performance projection tool estimates training throughput on multi-node clusters using two complementary approaches: **GPU benchmarking** (measuring real compute and communication on available hardware) and **analytical simulation** (modeling performance entirely on CPU without any GPUs). When GPUs are available, the default hybrid mode benchmarks representative layers and analytically models only the components that fall outside the benchmark scope. When no GPUs are available, the pure simulation mode provides estimates using analytical backends. A key design goal is flexibility: you can benchmark on as few GPUs as you have available — even a single GPU — project performance to arbitrary multi-node target configurations, or skip the GPU entirely and run the full projection analytically.

#### Sub-Node Benchmarking: Downscale, Measure, Upscale

A key capability of the performance projection is the ability to **benchmark on fewer GPUs than the target configuration requires** — even a single GPU — and analytically project performance to arbitrary multi-node deployments. The `--benchmark-gpus` flag controls how many GPUs are used for the benchmarking phase (defaults to `GPUS_PER_NODE`). This *downscale → measure → upscale* workflow eliminates the need to allocate a full target cluster for profiling.

Phase 1: Downscale (Configuration Reduction)

When the target configuration requires more GPUs than available for benchmarking, parallelism dimensions are automatically reduced in a carefully chosen priority order that minimizes analytical error during upscale:

1. **PP → 1** first — Pipeline parallelism is reduced first because its effect on iteration time is entirely determined by the pipeline schedule, which can be simulated exactly. Removing PP for benchmarking loses no compute information.
2. **EP reduced** next — If the config still doesn't fit, expert parallelism is reduced. The key insight is that **experts-per-rank is preserved**: `num_experts` is adjusted proportionally so each GPU still computes the same number of experts. This means the measured MoE MLP compute time accurately reflects the per-GPU workload at any EP scale. Only All-to-All communication needs analytical compensation.
3. **TP reduced** last — Tensor parallelism is reduced only as a last resort. TP reduction does affect compute (each GPU processes a larger tensor slice), so the projection must scale compute and add AllReduce overhead analytically.

**CP is never reduced** — for MoE models, CP is folded into EP (MoE Parallel Folding), so reducing it saves no GPUs. For dense models, reducing CP would change the per-GPU sequence length, fundamentally altering GEMM shapes and attention computation — the benchmark would no longer measure the target workload. In practice this is rarely a constraint: most dense models train at 8K–32K where CP=1.

For example, with `--benchmark-gpus 1` on a config that requires TP=1, PP=4, EP=8 (32 GPUs):

```text
Target:    TP=1, PP=4, EP=8, CP=1  →  32 GPUs (4 nodes)
Step 1:    PP → 1                  →  8 GPUs
Step 2:    EP 8 → 1               →  1 GPU  ✓
Benchmark on 1 GPU with reduced config
```

Phase 2: Measure (Layer Benchmarking)

With the reduced configuration, the tool benchmarks a minimal set of layers that covers every distinct layer type in the model. Rather than running the full transformer stack, it selects one layer per type — for a pure dense model, one dense layer; for an all-MoE model, one MoE layer; for a mixed architecture (e.g. DeepSeek with 3 dense + 58 MoE layers), one dense and one MoE layer. Each selected layer is benchmarked for forward and backward time separately. This works because all layers of the same type (dense or MoE) share identical architecture and GEMM shapes, differing only in learned weights, which do not affect kernel execution time.

When **PP=1**, the per-type average time is multiplied by the number of layers of that type in the full model — e.g. if the model has 3 dense and 58 MoE layers, the measured dense layer time is multiplied by 3 and the MoE layer time by 58. When **PP>1**, the pipeline schedule simulator takes over: it uses the model's layer assignment (which layers belong to which pipeline stage, respecting `decoder_first/last_pipeline_num_layers` and `pipeline_model_parallel_layout`) to build a per-stage time matrix, summing the per-type benchmark times for only the layers in each stage, and then simulates the full pipeline schedule with proper bubble accounting.

For MoE layers, the benchmarking uses **decomposed measurement**: compute time and All-to-All communication time are measured separately. This is critical because the A2A portion will be replaced analytically during upscale, while the compute portion is kept as-is.

Phase 3: Upscale (Analytical Restoration)

Each reduced dimension is restored analytically, composing the individual adjustments:

- **Restoring PP**: The pipeline schedule simulator reconstructs the target schedule (1F1B, interleaved, zero-bubble, etc.) from benchmarked per-layer times. P2P communication is estimated analytically, distinguishing intra-node vs. inter-node links.
- **Restoring EP**: Compute time is kept from the benchmark (experts-per-rank was preserved). The All-to-All communication delta between benchmark EP and target EP is added per MoE layer: `A2A_overhead = A2A(target_EP) − A2A(benchmark_EP)`. When decomposed A2A timings are available, the measured intra-node A2A anchors the model.
- **Restoring TP**: Two adjustments per layer: (1) compute scaled by `benchmark_tp / target_tp`, and (2) TP AllReduce delta added. When GPU-measured AllReduce data is available, ratio-based scaling provides better accuracy: `target_AR = measured_AR(bench_tp) × [analytical(target_tp) / analytical(bench_tp)]`.

Why This Priority Order?

The reduction order (PP → EP → TP) is ranked by analytical restoration fidelity:

| Dimension | Restoration Method | Primary Error Source |
|---|---|---|
| **PP** | Exact schedule simulation | P2P latency model only |
| **EP** | A2A delta (compute unchanged) | A2A analytical model |
| **TP** | Compute scaling + AR delta | Scaling linearity assumption |

PP restoration introduces the least error because pipeline scheduling is deterministic. EP restoration preserves compute fidelity and only models communication. TP restoration requires scaling compute and is therefore the last resort.

#### Two Approaches to Performance Projection

Primus supports two complementary approaches to performance projection — **benchmark-based** and **analytical simulation** — each with distinct strengths. Rather than prescribing one over the other, Primus lets users choose the right tool for their situation, and even run both side by side.

##### When Analytical Simulation Shines

The biggest advantage of analytical modeling is that **it doesn't require hardware**. When silicon isn't available — during capacity planning for a new cluster, evaluating a next-generation AMD Instinct™ accelerator architecture, or simply working from a laptop — simulation is the only option. Primus's `--profiling-mode simulate` mode enables full training projections entirely on CPU, using [Origami](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-libraries/tree/develop/shared/origami) for GEMM modeling and an SDPA simulator for attention kernels. Analytical models are also **fast and reproducible**: they produce deterministic results without the variance inherent in GPU measurements, making them ideal for sweeping large configuration spaces or comparing parallelism strategies quickly. When the analytical backends are well-correlated with the target hardware, the accuracy can be quite close to real measurements, especially for compute-bound GEMM operations where the models capture tile-level execution, CU utilization, and memory hierarchy behavior in detail.

Beyond current hardware, analytical simulation is uniquely valuable for **pre-silicon performance estimation**. Given the architectural specifications of a future AMD Instinct™ GPU, the simulation backends can project training performance on hardware that doesn't physically exist yet. This enables a range of pre-silicon experiments: estimating how a next-generation AMD Instinct™ accelerator will perform on specific model architectures, comparing the impact of different hardware design choices (e.g., more CUs vs. higher memory bandwidth) on end-to-end training throughput, and identifying potential bottlenecks (compute-bound vs. memory-bound vs. communication-bound) before silicon tapeout. This capability also helps inform **hardware definition** itself — by running projections across a matrix of hypothetical hardware specs and target workloads, architects can quantify which hardware parameters matter most for the workloads they care about, guiding investment in the features that deliver the greatest real-world training performance. Primus supports this workflow through its `--gpu-arch` flag and customizable hardware configuration files, allowing users to define arbitrary hardware profiles and project performance against them.

##### When Benchmarking Shines

Benchmarking on real hardware captures effects that are difficult to model analytically with high fidelity:

1. **Actual GPU frequency under load.** AMD Instinct™ GPUs dynamically adjust clock frequency during kernel execution to stay within their power envelope. The theoretical peak FLOPs use the maximum boost clock, but under sustained dense matrix workloads (which dominate LLM training), the accelerator runs at a lower operating frequency due to the higher power consumed by dedicated silicon for lower-precision matrix multiplication. The resulting Max‑Achievable FLOPs (MAF) can be materially lower than peak; published data for prior‑generation AMD Instinct™ MI300X and AMD Instinct™ MI325X GPUs shows substantial gaps under sustained dense workloads (see [Understanding Peak, Max‑Achievable & Delivered FLOPs](https://rocm.blogs.amd.com/software-tools-optimization/Understanding_Peak_and_Max-Achievable_FLOPS/README.html)). A pure analytical or roofline-based model typically uses peak FLOPs (or a manually tuned efficiency factor) in its denominator, which can lead to overestimated predictions. Crucially, this frequency behavior is workload-dependent — different layer types (attention vs. MLP vs. MoE expert GEMMs) have different compute densities and therefore sustain different frequencies. Benchmarking captures this per-layer variation automatically.

2. **Robustness to software stack variations.** Every update to the AMD ROCm™ software stack — a new hipBLASLt release with improved GEMM kernels, a CK attention kernel update, a Triton recompile with different tiling — shifts the achievable performance for each operation. An analytical model needs periodic recorrelation against the latest software version. The benchmark approach is inherently version-aware: it runs the actual kernels installed on the system and measures what they deliver, automatically reflecting the current software stack's performance.

3. **Real grouped GEMM behavior for MoE models.** For MoE models, the routed expert computation uses grouped GEMMs, whose performance is harder to model analytically. The achieved efficiency depends on the number of experts and topk routing, token-to-expert distribution (affecting padding and load imbalance), the specific grouped GEMM kernel implementation (CK, hipBLASLt, AITER), and wave quantization effects from non-uniform sub-problem sizes. Grouped GEMMs often operate well below the roofline due to the overhead of managing many small sub-problems. Benchmarking sidesteps this by measuring actual grouped GEMM execution on representative problem shapes.

4. **Framework and runtime overhead.** Real training iterations include overhead beyond raw kernel execution: PyTorch dispatch latency, memory allocator behavior, kernel launch overhead, CUDA/HIP stream synchronization, and torch.compile optimization effects. These overheads are present in benchmark measurements but absent from an analytical model that only considers the mathematical operations. For large models with many layers, these per-kernel overheads accumulate and can represent a non-trivial fraction of iteration time.

##### The Hybrid Approach: Measure What You Can, Simulate What You Can't

Primus's default mode combines both approaches. The guiding principle is: **measure what you can, simulate what you can't**. When the benchmark GPUs can accommodate a parallelism dimension (e.g., TP AllReduce within a node, EP All-to-All within the benchmark config), the communication is measured alongside compute. Only communication that falls outside the benchmark scope — inter-node traffic, or overhead from reduced parallelism dimensions — is estimated analytically. Communication collectives are generally more analytically tractable than compute kernels, as their performance is dominated by bandwidth and latency with predictable message sizes. Pipeline scheduling follows deterministic rules that can be simulated exactly given per-stage compute times.

##### Side-by-Side Validation

Primus offers a `--profiling-mode both` option that runs benchmark and simulation side by side and prints a comparison table. This lets users quantify how closely the analytical path tracks real hardware, validate that simulation backends remain calibrated as hardware and software evolve, and make informed decisions about when simulation alone is sufficient.

The following table summarizes when each approach is most useful:

| Factor | Analytical Simulation | GPU Benchmarking |
|--------|-----------------------|------------------|
| Hardware availability | **No GPU required** — works on CPU | Requires access to target GPUs |
| Speed and reproducibility | **Fast, deterministic** — ideal for config sweeps | Slower, with measurement variance |
| Pre-silicon / capacity planning | **Primary use case** — estimates before hardware exists | Not possible without hardware |
| GPU frequency under load | Estimates based on hardware model | **Captures actual frequency throttling** per workload |
| Software stack sensitivity | Requires periodic correlation | **Automatically reflects** current kernel performance |
| Grouped GEMM for MoE | Depends on model fidelity | **Measured directly** with real kernels |
| Framework / runtime overhead | Not captured | **Included** in benchmark measurements |
| Communication modeling | Analytical models for all collectives | **Measured** when within benchmark scope; analytical fallback otherwise |
| Pipeline scheduling | Simulated exactly | Simulated exactly (same simulator) |
| Cross-validation | Available via `--profiling-mode both` | Available via `--profiling-mode both` |

#### Profiling Modes

The tool supports three profiling modes, making it usable across different environments:

| Mode | GPU Required | What it does |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| `benchmark` (default) | **Yes** | Runs real GPU kernels on the benchmark GPUs and measures forward/backward times |
| `simulate` | **No** | Uses Origami (GEMM) and SDPA Simulator (attention) analytical backends — no GPU needed |
| `both` | **Yes** | Runs both side-by-side for accuracy comparison |

When you **don't have access to a GPU** (e.g., capacity planning on a laptop), the `simulate` mode enables full training projection entirely on CPU.

#### Simulation Backends

Two analytical backends power the simulation mode:

**Origami (GEMM Backend)** — [Origami](https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-libraries/tree/develop/shared/origami) is an open-source tool (part of the AMD ROCm™ ecosystem) that provides analytical performance modeling for GEMM kernels on AMD Instinct™ GPUs. Primus uses Origami to predict execution times for all GEMM operations — attention projections (Q, K, V, O), MLP (gate, up, down), MoE expert GEMMs, embedding, and output layers. It models the GPU's Compute Units (CUs), memory hierarchy, and tile-level execution, with built-in hardware profiles for AMD Instinct™ MI300X, AMD Instinct™ MI325X, and AMD Instinct™ MI355X GPUs.

**SDPA Simulator (Attention Backend)** — Models Flash Attention v3 (FAv3) kernel execution analytically using Origami's 1-CU tile-level model. Flash Attention is a fused kernel where QKᵀ, softmax, and PV execute sequentially within each workgroup. The simulator computes `total_time = (per-tile-QKᵀ + per-tile-PV) × num_waves`, capturing wave quantization and per-tile efficiency. It also models the backward dQ atomic overhead from `buffer_atomic_add_f32` accumulation across KV-workgroups.

#### How It Works

The performance projection follows a multi-step pipeline:

1. **Configuration Reduction** — If the target parallelism configuration requires more GPUs than are available for benchmarking, the tool automatically reduces the config to fit. Parallelism dimensions are reduced in a fixed priority order:
   - **PP → 1** first (easiest to add back — overhead estimated via the pipeline schedule simulator)
   - **EP reduced** next if the configuration still doesn't fit (MoE compute stays accurate since experts-per-rank is preserved; only A2A is replaced analytically)
   - **TP reduced** last if PP and EP reduction were not sufficient (compute is scaled by `benchmark_tp / target_tp` and TP AllReduce overhead is added analytically)

   The benchmark GPU count is controlled by `--benchmark-gpus` (defaults to `GPUS_PER_NODE`). This enables benchmarking on as few as 1 GPU and projecting performance to multi-node configurations.

2. **Layer Benchmarking** — The tool benchmarks each transformer layer type (dense attention layers, MoE layers) on the available benchmark GPUs by measuring forward and backward pass times separately. Only representative layers are benchmarked (1 dense + 1 MoE) for efficiency.

3. **Extrapolation to Full Model** — Per-layer times are multiplied by the total layer count, accounting for the model's MoE layer frequency pattern. If TP was reduced, compute times are scaled by `benchmark_tp / target_tp` and the TP AllReduce overhead delta is added.

4. **Pipeline Simulation** — For PP > 1, the pipeline schedule simulator reconstructs the full 1F1B, interleaved, or zero-bubble schedule with proper send/receive synchronization, calculating step time and bubble ratio.

5. **Communication Overhead** — Communication that was already captured in the benchmark (e.g., intra-node TP AllReduce, EP All-to-All within the benchmark config) is included in the measured times. For communication outside the benchmark scope — inter-node DP gradient AllReduce, P2P for pipeline stages, or overhead from reduced parallelism dimensions — analytical models estimate the cost, differentiating between intra-node and inter-node links.

6. **Multi-node Scaling** — The final projection combines all components:

```text
Projected_Time = Base_Time × (Min_DP / Target_DP) + Communication_Overhead
```

#### Communication Modeling

When a parallelism dimension fits within the benchmark GPU count, its communication is **measured** as part of the benchmark — no analytical modeling needed. For communication that falls outside the benchmark scope (e.g., inter-node collectives, or overhead from reduced parallelism dimensions), the tool uses analytical models, selecting the best algorithm for each:

| Collective | Used By | Model |
|------------|---------|-------|
| AllReduce | TP, DP (gradients) | Best of Ring/Hypercube/Bruck/Single-shot |
| All-to-All | EP (MoE dispatch/combine) | Pairwise exchange, accounts for topology |
| P2P Send/Recv | PP (activations) | Point-to-point latency + bandwidth |

Communication times differ significantly based on whether they are **intra-node** (fast, e.g., xGMI/NVLink) or **inter-node** (slower, e.g., InfiniBand/RoCE). These hardware parameters are customizable — users can provide a hardware configuration file via `--hardware-config` to match their specific cluster topology.

#### Pipeline Schedule Simulator

The pipeline simulator supports multiple scheduling algorithms:

| Algorithm | VPP | Description |
|-----------|-----|-------------|
| **1F1B** | 1 | Standard one-forward-one-backward schedule |
| **Interleaved 1F1B** | >1 | Multiple virtual chunks per rank for reduced bubble ratio |
| **Zero-Bubble** | 1 | Splits backward into B (input gradient) + W (weight gradient) with F-B-W steady-state pattern to minimize bubbles |
| **ZBV Formatted** | 2 | Zero-Bubble V-shape schedule with structured warm-up/stable/cool-down phases across two virtual chunks |
| **ZBV Greedy** | 2 | Zero-Bubble V-shape schedule using greedy placement with configurable memory modes (`min` or `half`) |
| **Sea AI Lab ILP** | 1 | ILP-based memory-aware scheduler (from Sea AI Lab) that optimally fills pipeline bubbles with W operations |

Zero-bubble scheduling minimizes pipeline bubbles by splitting the backward pass into B (input gradient) and W (weight gradient). Since W doesn't depend on receiving gradients from the next stage, it can be scheduled more flexibly to fill pipeline bubbles. For VPP=1, the basic zero-bubble scheduler uses a fixed F-B-W steady-state pattern, while Sea AI Lab's ILP-based scheduler optimally places W operations using integer linear programming. For VPP=2, the ZBV (Zero-Bubble V-shape) family of schedulers extends this idea across two virtual pipeline chunks — **ZBV Formatted** uses a structured pattern with deterministic phase transitions, while **ZBV Greedy** uses a greedy placement algorithm with memory-aware scheduling. Users can compare all algorithms at once using `--pipeline-schedule-algorithm all`, which runs all applicable schedulers and selects the best performing one. For a deep dive into how these pipeline scheduling algorithms are designed and implemented in Primus, see the [Primus-pipeline blog](https://rocm.blogs.amd.com/software-tools-optimization/primus-pipeline/README.html).

### Parallelism Modeling

The projection tool models how each parallelism dimension affects performance:

**Tensor Parallelism (TP)** — Splits individual layer weights across GPUs within a node. When benchmarking is performed at the same TP as the target configuration, TP communication (AllReduce after each layer) is already captured in the benchmark. However, when the benchmark GPU count is too small to accommodate the target TP (e.g., benchmarking on 1 GPU for a TP=8 config), TP is reduced during benchmarking as a last resort (after PP and EP). The projection then compensates by: (1) scaling per-GPU compute by `benchmark_tp / target_tp`, and (2) adding the TP AllReduce overhead delta analytically. When GPU-measured AllReduce data is available, it anchors the analytical model for better accuracy.

**Pipeline Parallelism (PP)** — Distributes layers across pipeline stages. PP is always the first dimension reduced during benchmarking (set to 1). A pipeline scheduler simulator then reconstructs the full target schedule analytically, accounting for bubble overhead and microbatch interleaving.

**Expert Parallelism (EP)** — Distributes MoE experts across GPUs. EP is the second dimension reduced if needed. The tool estimates inter-node All-to-All overhead by comparing the A2A time for benchmark EP (intra-node) vs. target EP (potentially inter-node). MoE compute stays accurate because experts-per-rank is preserved during EP rescaling.

**Context Parallelism (CP)** — For MoE models, CP is folded into EP via MoE Parallel Folding — CP ranks are a subset of EP ranks, so the minimum GPU count remains `TP × PP × EP` instead of `TP × PP × EP × CP`. For dense models, CP is an independent axis. CP is kept unchanged during benchmarking.

**Data Parallelism (DP)** — Provides linear speedup by processing more batches in parallel. Gradient AllReduce is overlapped with backward computation by default.

    projection performance \
    --config examples/megatron/configs/MI355X/mixtral_8x22B_v0.1-BF16-pretrain.yaml \
    --target-nodes 4
```

### Performance Projection (Simulation Mode — No GPU Required)

Run a full training projection entirely on CPU using analytical backends:

```bash
bash runner/primus-cli direct --script primus/cli/main.py -- \
    projection performance \
    --config examples/megatron/configs/MI355X/mixtral_8x22B_v0.1-BF16-pretrain.yaml \
    --profiling-mode simulate \
    --target-nodes 4
```

Target a specific AMD Instinct™ GPU architecture for simulation:

```bash
bash runner/primus-cli direct --script primus/cli/main.py -- \
    projection performance \
    --config examples/megatron/configs/MI355X/mixtral_8x22B_v0.1-BF16-pretrain.yaml \
    --profiling-mode simulate --gpu-arch mi355x \
    --target-nodes 4
```

### Sub-Node Benchmarking (Benchmark on Fewer GPUs)

Benchmark on a single GPU and project to multi-node:

```bash
export NNODES=1
export GPUS_PER_NODE=8

bash runner/primus-cli direct --script primus/cli/main.py -- \
    projection performance \
    --config examples/megatron/configs/MI355X/mixtral_8x22B_v0.1-BF16-pretrain.yaml \
    --benchmark-gpus 1 \
    --target-nodes 4
```

The tool automatically reduces PP, EP, and if necessary TP to fit on the benchmark GPU count, then restores the full target configuration analytically during projection. This is useful when only a fraction of a node is available for profiling.

### Compare Benchmark vs. Simulation

Validate simulation accuracy against real hardware:

```bash
bash runner/primus-cli direct --script primus/cli/main.py -- \
    projection performance \
    --config examples/megatron/configs/MI355X/mixtral_8x22B_v0.1-BF16-pretrain.yaml \
    --profiling-mode both \
    --target-nodes 4
```

### Parallelism Overrides

Override parallelism settings from the config file:

```bash
export PRIMUS_TP=1
export PRIMUS_PP=3
export PRIMUS_EP=8

bash runner/primus-cli direct --script primus/cli/main.py -- \
    projection performance \
    --config examples/megatron/configs/MI355X/mixtral_8x22B_v0.1-BF16-pretrain.yaml \
    --target-nodes 6
```

## Example Output

The following is representative output from a Mixtral 8×22B BF16 projection on an AMD Instinct™ MI355X GPU (benchmarked on 1 node, projected to 8 nodes).

## Validation: Projected vs. Measured Results

To validate the projection tool's accuracy, we compared projected performance against measured results published on the [AMD ROCm™ Performance Results](https://www.amd.com/en/developer/resources/rocm-hub/dev-ai/performance-results.html#ai-training) page. The workflow is straightforward: benchmark on a single node, then project to 8 nodes and compare against the published multi-node measurements. The projections were obtained by providing the corresponding hardware configuration files via `--hardware-config`.

The projection results were obtained at Primus commit [`2d937b9`](https://github.com/AMD-AGI/Primus/tree/2d937b9eab4e6c0a6e423d34592a8cebf9a4a5b6). Each table below lists the Docker container and release date used for the measured runs. The external results page is updated over time and may differ from the values shown here.

### Key Takeaways

- **All projections are within 10% of measured results**, spanning both dense (Llama) and MoE (Mixtral) architectures, FP8 and BF16 precision, and two different AMD Instinct™ accelerator generations (AMD Instinct™ MI325X and AMD Instinct™ MI355X GPUs).
- The Mixtral result exercises the full projection pipeline: PP reduction (benchmark PP=1, target PP=4), EP All-to-All modeling, and pipeline schedule simulation with VPP=2 — yet still achieves <10% error.

## Assumptions and Limitations

### Assumptions

1. **DP Weak Scaling** — DP scaling assumes weak scaling (constant micro-batch size per GPU); the DP gradient AllReduce overhead is modeled analytically
2. **Communication Model** — Bandwidth efficiency uses a constant factor; all NICs are used in parallel for inter-node traffic
3. **Pipeline Bubbles** — B/W split is 50/50 for zero-bubble scheduling
4. **Gradient AllReduce** — By default overlapped with compute; if disabled, added to critical path
5. **MoE All-to-All** — All-to-All time scales with EP size

### Limitations

1. **Benchmark Accuracy with Reduced Parallelism** — Benchmarking with reduced PP/EP/TP may not capture all behaviors (e.g., GEMM efficiency differences at different TP levels)
2. **Communication Contention** — Model doesn't account for network contention; assumes dedicated bandwidth per collective
3. **Memory Pressure** — The memory impact on performance (e.g., HBM pressure from high activation footprint) is not fully modeled
4. **Hardware Heterogeneity** — Assumes homogeneous nodes; GPU frequency variations are not modeled

## Tips

- **Start with memory projection**: Run `projection memory` first to verify your model fits in GPU memory before benchmarking performance.
- **Benchmark with what you have**: Use `--benchmark-gpus` to run benchmarks on any number of GPUs (even 1) and project to multi-node. The tool handles parallelism downscaling (PP → EP → TP) and analytical upscaling automatically.
- **No GPU? Use simulation**: With `--profiling-mode simulate`, you can run performance projection entirely on CPU. This is useful for capacity planning without GPU access.
- **Validate simulation accuracy**: Use `--profiling-mode both` to compare simulation against real benchmarks.
- **Understand scaling limits**: DP scaling is limited by `global_batch_size / micro_batch_size`. If you run out of microbatches, adding more nodes won't help.
- **Pipeline scaling**: With PP > 1, layers don't need to divide evenly across stages. The tool distributes remainder layers to the first stages (e.g., 61 layers with PP=4 → [16, 15, 15, 15]). You can also supply explicit per-stage layer counts via `decoder_first_pipeline_num_layers`, `decoder_last_pipeline_num_layers`, or `pipeline_model_parallel_layout`.
- **Recomputation trade-off**: Full recompute dramatically reduces activation memory (e.g., 18 GB → 0.25 GB per MoE layer) at the cost of ~33% more compute.
- **MoE activation dominance**: For MoE models, the MoE MLP activation (scaled by `topk`) typically dominates the per-layer activation budget.

## Summary

Primus projection provides a practical way to de-risk large-scale LLM training before launching expensive runs. Instead of relying on trial-and-error, it helps answer key planning questions up front: **will the model fit in memory** and **what throughput can I expect at target scale**.

- For memory planning, it uses a hierarchical, module-aligned profiler to estimate parameter, optimizer, and activation footprints per GPU, with support for MoE routing effects, pipeline in-flight microbatches, and activation recomputation.
- For performance planning, it supports three modes: `benchmark` (measure real kernels), `simulate` (CPU-only analytical modeling), and `both` (side-by-side validation), so it remains useful whether or not GPUs are available.
- For scaling projection, it combines measured layer times with analytical communication and pipeline schedule simulation, including PP/EP/TP rescaling for sub-node benchmarks and topology-aware intra-node vs. inter-node cost modeling.
- In validation examples, projected throughput tracks measured multi-node results closely (within about 10%), making the tool suitable for early capacity planning, parallelism design-space exploration, and pre-silicon what-if analysis.

A recommended workflow is: run `projection memory` first, run `projection performance` in the most appropriate mode for your environment, and then iterate TP/PP/EP/CP/DP choices to meet memory and throughput targets.
