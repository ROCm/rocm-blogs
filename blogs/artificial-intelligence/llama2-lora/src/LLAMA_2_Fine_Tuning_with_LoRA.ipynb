    "In the dynamic realm of Generative AI (GenAI), fine-tuning LLMs (such as Llama 2) poses distinctive challenges related to substantial computational and memory requirements. LoRA introduces a compelling solution, allowing rapid and cost-effective fine-tuning of state-of-the-art LLMs. This breakthrough capability not only expedites the tuning process, but also lowers associated costs.\n",

It involves using a new data set--one that is specific to the current task--to update the model's weights. It's typically not possible to fine-tune LLMs on consumer hardware due to inadequate memory and computing power. However, in this tutorial, we use LoRA to overcome these challenges."

    "Standard (full-parameter) fine-tuning involves considering all parameters. It requires significant computational power to manage optimizer states and gradient check-pointing. The resulting memory footprint is typically about four times larger than the model itself. For example, loading a 7 billion parameter model (e.g. Llama 2) in FP32 (4 bytes per parameter) requires approximately 28 GB of GPU memory, while fine-tuning demands around 28*4=112 GB of GPU memory. Note that the 112 GB figure is derived empirically, and various factors like batch size, data precision, and gradient accumulation contribute to overall memory usage.\n",
